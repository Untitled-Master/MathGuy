# MathGuy

Welcome to **MathGuy**, a peaceful space where I share my thoughts about **math**, **physics**, and **philosophy**.

I chose the name "**MathGuy**" because my love for **math** has been with me since childhood, and I aspire to create a better atmosphere here than the world I live in.

**Philosophy** holds a special place in my heart as the best means of expressing thoughts. It goes beyond being just a **science**; it's a profound exploration of ideas.

**Physics** is an integral part of our existence. I am **physics**, you are **physics** - together, **WE ARE PHYSICS**.
